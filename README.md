# KPMG-Virtual-Experience-Program
Given raw customer and transaction data of a hypothetical organization which sells bikes & cycling accessories, I need to complete a three-sections task.
1. Data Quality Assessment - Clean data based on Standard Data Quality Dimensions
2. Data Insights - Analyze data for Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation
3. Data Visualizations - Visualize data to suggest what group of new customers to target


## Development Stack
```
Data Cleaning: Power Query Editor

Data Analysis: Data View and Relationship, DAX

Data Visualization: Dashboard and Report 
```
